# Instagram Challenge

Built over a weekend, this Rails app aims to clone the basic functionality of Instagram. To run it:

- Clone this repository
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `rake db:migrate`
- Run `bin/rails s`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your favourite browser
- Enjoy the instagram clone!
